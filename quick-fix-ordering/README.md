* For out of scope variables, "define variable" and "add argument to function" appear ahead of importing related fixes

  Importing takes precedence
  
* Inconsistent quoting of variable names

  > Add argument 'variableName' to function
  
  > Add variableName to import list of Module
  
* > Add argument 'variableName' to function
  
  and
  
  > Add variableName to import list of Module
  
  both start with "Add", which is less scannable.

* No more "import qualified" quick fix
